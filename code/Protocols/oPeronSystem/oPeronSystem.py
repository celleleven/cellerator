## This goes along with HelloBio, using the yeast to make the needed molecular tools.
# Howerver is has the task of making needed reagents, and testing all features offered by Cellerator.
# Hello Bio, will incubate, transmutat, and amplify yeast to produce; yeast, DNA ladder,
# RNAase, DNAase, Protease, Taq polymerase, an a hand full of Restriction Enzymes.
# All of these are in the oPeronSystem Gene (OS).


##### oPeronSystem generate
# Taq polymerase [[https://bit.ly/3pVMXjq]]
# DNA lader <--- Made by digesting Yeast DNA
# RNAase
