Yeast transformation protocol

# Yeast transformation https://capricorn.bc.edu//bi204/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Chapter-12-2015.pdf

# Prepare a transformation master mix.  The following ingredients provide enough reagents for five transformation reactions.  Combine and mix in a microcentrifuge tube:

# 100 µL sterile 2 M lithium acetate (freshly prepared)
# 400 µL sterile 50% PEG-335
# 4  µL 2-mercaptoethanol (STINKY!!  add this in the fume hood!)


# Add 15 µL of the denatured salmon sperm DNA (2 mg/mL) to a new microcentrifuge tube labeled with the name (or code) of the plasmid.

# Note:  It is important for the salmon sperm DNA to be single-stranded for this procedure to work well.  Boil the DNA for 5 minutes to denature the DNA.  Quick chill the DNA by  placing it immediately on ice.  Keep the DNA on ice until you are ready to use it.

#3. Add 5 µL of miniprep plasmid DNA to the appropriately labeled microcentrifuge tube.  4.  Add 100 µL of transformation mix from step 1 to each microcentrifuge tube.  Vortex for 10-15 seconds to mix the contents. 5.   Using a sterile toothpick or micropipette tip, scrape a large yeast colony (or the equivalent of a “match head” of yeast) from a YPD plate.  Transfer the yeast to the microcentrifuge tube containing the transformation/DNA solution (step 4) by twirling the toothpick several times.  Be sure that the cells are uniformly suspended before proceeding.
